Infinite Eighties
===============

This is a song you can copy and paste into Sonic Pi. It reminds me of a groovy eighties song but it's infinitely long and changes as you listen to it.

## Installation

1. Download [Sonic Pi](http://sonic-pi.net/).

2. Copy and paste the code inside and press play.

## Information

This song was made with some simple rhythm randomizing techniques you can check out on [my blog](www.alexbeeken.com). This was intended to add some color to the rhythm randomizations that I was experimenting with in that post.

From a music theory standpoint, this technique of creating and randomizing simple rhythms could be used to create modern pop music. It could never create a melody or have knowledge of how the sections might relate to one another.
